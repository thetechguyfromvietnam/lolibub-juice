# To Upload Your Code to GitHub

## The token provided has read-only access. Here's what to do:

### Option 1: Create a New Token with Write Permissions

2. Create new token: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
3. Name: "lolibub-juice-write"
4. **Check these scopes:**
   - ✅ repo (full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ workflow (if you want GitHub Actions)
5. Generate and copy the token
6. Run: git push origin main

### Option 2: Use GitHub Desktop
1. Download: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. File → Add Local Repository → Select this folder
4. Click "Publish repository"
5. ✅ It handles authentication automatically!

### Option 3: Upload via GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to: https://github.com/thetechguyfromvietnam/lolibub-juice
2. Upload files manually
3. Then clone and push normally

**Current Status:**
